# Horiseon Webpage Week 1 Challenge Edmond Su

## Description

The purpose of this project was to gain experience of possible real world on the job projects where we are required to modify existing code. Here I learnt the purpose of using correct html semantics as originally there was none, making it hard to follow the code. I also learnt the importance of commenting as it gives other people that may read your code what that line or section of code is doing. I also learnt how to streamline code by using id and class properties correctly to reduce repetition of code.
